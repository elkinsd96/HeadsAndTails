A java program that converts a number between 0 and 512 to binary number. The 0's and 1's of the number are then converted to H's or T's representing Heads or Tails. 
0 stands for Heads, 1 stands for Tails. The H's and T's are then stored in specific positions within a 3 by 3 matrix and printed to the screen.
